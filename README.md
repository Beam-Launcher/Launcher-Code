This Custom BeamNG.Drive Launcher called 'Beam-Launcher' has been made to fill a gap in the game. A stylish choice for a launcher. 
I have Tried my very hardest to create a familiar yet new design for the well loved game. It was a challenge, not smooth sailing. 
All code for the design, functionality and events are included aswell as a executable and visual studio solution file to view and edit.

Please report any broken or problematic features to this email: Beam-Launcher@hotmail.com
Alternativly, you can edit the code in the form1.vb in the open file section if there it an issue regarding file systems.
